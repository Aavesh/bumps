    ECE495S: Vertically Intergrated Projects (VIP)
    iPhone Team -- Vehicle Data Logging

    Team Members:
        Matt Swanson, swanson@purdue.edu (Senior - CompE)
        Jevin Sweval, jsweval@purdue.edu (Senior - CompE)
        Joey Ernst, jernst@purdue.edu (Grad - EE/Civil)

    Advisor:
        Aaron Ault, ault@purdue.edu (ECE, CWSA)

    Goals:  
        Log data from vehicles using a wireless ODB-II
        sensor and iPhone GPS/Accelerometer; use iPhone
        to transmit data to external database; raw data
        will be used for other research projects possibly
        related to traffic light control, pot-hole detection,
        or GPS error correction
