OBDII Logging Server (TCP)
ECE495TUV - Spring 2010 VIP
#####################################
Make sure that the server is running before you attempt
to log any data with the iPhone app or it will not work.

#####################################
LAUNCHING THE SERVER
#####################################
You should be in the iphone-logger directory.

>> pwd
/home/$NAME/iphone-logger

>> nohup python server/tcp_server.py &


#####################################
SERVER SETUP AND CONFIGURATION
#####################################
Ensure that the `db.conf` settings file is located in the 
iphone-logger directory.  This file contains the password 
and requisite information to use the database.  This file
is not in the git repository and is stored locally on the
server (msee140lnx10.ecn.purdue.edu).

The TCP Server runs on port 8005, so make sure that port
is not being blocked by the firewall or else you will
not be able to log data.  For assistance with this, contact
Aaron Ault.

You may verify the servers operation by connecting via
Telnet.  The server expects data in the following, colon-
delimited format on a single line:

    log_id:obd_pid:data_bytes

If the data is valid, it will be decoded and logged to the
database.  If not, you should receive an error message.

On a fresh install, use the `mysql-setup` file to rebuild
the database structure.  The server will require Python,
twisted, and the MySQLdb module to run the code.  These
packages can be installed using apt-get.
