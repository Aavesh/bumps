Bumps - iPhone OBDII Logging App
ECE495TUV - Spring 2010 VIP
#####################################
The full source code and Xcode project files are in the Bumps
directory.  You may open and build the project to Xcode.  Using
the certificates and provisioning profiles from the Purdue
internal developer portal, you can install the application onto
specified iPhone devices.  The app has only been tested with the
iPhone 3G model.

The app itself is self-explanatory, but requires a small amount
of prep work before using it.

#####################################
BEFORE LAUNCHING THE APPLICATION:
#####################################
The OBDKey WiFi device must be plugged into your car's OBDII port.
See your car's manual if you are unsure where this is.  Currently,
the application has only be tested on Honda Accords so be aware 
that the app may not work on a different model.

Due to API restrictions in the iPhone SDK, you must connect your
iPhone to the OBDKey WiFi network manually before using the app.
The iPhone will be communication with the car computer over WiFi
and logging data back to the server over 3G; ensure that both of
these services are enabled, active and have good signal strength
for best operation.

Secure the iPhone to the cupholder attachment.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
OPERATE THE iPHONE OR MONITOR THE SERVER WITH A LAPTOP WHILE
DRIVING!  Once you have launched the application, there should be
no need for you to interact with it until you are done logging
data.

#####################################
AFTER LAUNCHING THE APPLICATION:
#####################################
At the top of the screen, enter a logging ID using the
onscreen keyboard.  This will be used to retrieve the data from 
the database at a later time.  The ID can be a string of up to
20 characters, but only alphanumeric characters are recommended.

Use the slider to turn logging on once you have reached your
starting destination and set the correct logging ID.  The current
data values are displayed in real-time on the iPhone.  This
serves mainly as a sanity check that the iPhone is successfully
communicating with the OBDKey and that the GPS and accelerometer
are working.  If you see the values updating, then it is a safe
bet that everything is working correctly and your data is being
logged.

#####################################
AFTER COMPLETEING DATA LOGGING:
#####################################
When you are finished logging data and are safely in park, use
the slider to turn logging off.  The last data values will persist
on the screen, but no new data will be sent to the database.

Close the application and turn off the iPhone to save batteries.
At this time, it is also recommended that you unplug the OBDKey
WiFi device, as it will still draw power from the car battery when
not in use and even when the engine is off.

To view your data, you may run a SQL query against the MySQL
database or view it directly using the phpMyAdmin tool installed
on the server.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If the application crashes, doesn't update the sensor values or 
doesn't appear to be logging anything to the database, perform
the following steps:

    1) Ensure you still have a solid WiFi and 3G connect to
        the OBDKey and database respectively
    2) Restart the application
    3) Unplug and re-plug in the OBDKey device; it sometimes
        gets into an error state and the easiest way to fix
        it is to just do a hard-reset
    4) Verify the server is operational via Telnet

If none of these steps solves the problem, then you are probably
out of luck.  Flip a coin, if heads: blame Joey, if tails: blame
Apple.
